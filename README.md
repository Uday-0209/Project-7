# condition-monitering-of-the-ball-screw
This project was developed to detect faults in the ball screw and coupling of the test rig. The model is based on vibration data. By analyzing changes in vibration and its features, the model predicts whether the system's vibration is 'Good' or 'Bad,' and also assesses the condition of the coupling
